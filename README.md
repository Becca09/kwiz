Kwiz Project

Description
Kwiz is a web application designed to create and take quizzes on various subjects. It allows users to select a quiz topic and difficulty level, answer questions, and receive instant feedback on their performance. The project is built using Next.js for the frontend and utilizes React Router for navigation, React Hook Form for form management, and React Toastify for displaying notifications.

Features
Users can select a quiz topic from a list of available subjects.
Users can choose the difficulty level of the quiz (easy, medium, difficult).
At the end of the quiz, users receive a summary of their performance, including the number of correct answers and a calculated score.
Users can navigate back to the home page or select a new quiz topic after completing a quiz.
